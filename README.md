Hi there, I'm Rishabh Kumar Dhirhe! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m a passionate about Data Science and Analysis with a deep interest in machine learning, predictive analytics, and data-driven insights. My goal is to explore the world of data, uncover meaningful patterns, and build intelligent systems. If you're interested in data science or want to collaborate on exciting projects, you've come to the right place!

ðŸš€ Projects
Here are some of the key projects I've worked on:

Public Projects
1. Titanic Survival App Using Streamlit
Description: Designed an interactive web application using Streamlit to predict Titanic survival probability. Integrated a trained ML model, allowing users to input features and get real-time predictions.

2. Multimodal Content Analysis Using Deep Learning
Description: Built a deep learning model to analyze text and image data simultaneously. Used CNNs for image processing and transformers for NLP to extract insights from multimodal datasets.

3. Analysis of Customer Churn and Prediction Using ML
Description: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and trained ML models to predict customer churn. Applied logistic regression, decision trees, and boosting techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

4. Time Series Analysis and Visualization on Stock Price Data
Description: Analyzed stock price trends using time series forecasting techniques like ARIMA, LSTM, and Exponential Smoothing. Visualized trends and seasonality patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

5. Online Payment Fraud Detection Using ML
Description: Developed a fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. Handled imbalanced datasets with SMOTE and improved model performance using ensemble learning techniques.

6. Movie Recommendation System Using Python
Description: Built a recommendation system using collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. Implemented cosine similarity and matrix factorization methods to generate personalized movie recommendations.

7. Customer Segmentation Using K-Means
Description: Applied unsupervised learning to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. Used K-Means clustering to group similar customers and performed data visualization to interpret the segments.

8. Recognizing Handwritten Digits
Description: Implemented a deep learning model using CNNs to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Trained the model with backpropagation and optimization techniques to achieve high accuracy.

9. Fake News Detection Using ML
Description: Built a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Implemented TF-IDF vectorization, word embeddings, and various classification algorithms like NaÃ¯ve Bayes and Random Forest.

10. Cat and Dog Classification Using CNN
Description: Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs. Used image preprocessing, data augmentation, and transfer learning techniques to improve accuracy. Evaluated performance using confusion matrix and precision-recall metrics.

I have worked on several other projects, all available in their respective repositories. Feel free to explore them.
